# CustomGento_Cookiebot
This Magento 1 module integrates Cookiebot into your store. This is useful to give the customer the possibility to block unwanted cookies and only allow wanted cookies. It requires an active Cookiebot subscription and can be completely configured in your Cookiebot account.

## Features
This extension adds the Cookiebot script as the first script on the page. This is required, so that Cookiebot can automatically block cookies from all included scripts. We currently only support the auto-blocking mode. Since using the manual mode requires [manual changes](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/) anyway, we do not see value in adding support for this.

## Configuration
After installing the extension, just go to Stores > Configuration > Web > Cookiebot Settings to enable Cookiebot and enter your Cookiebot ID. You find the ID in your Cookiebot account under Settings > Your scripts. All other configuration regarding the cookie overlay is done in your Cookiebot account.

## Disclaimer
You need a [Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com/) account, so that this extension does anything useful for you.
